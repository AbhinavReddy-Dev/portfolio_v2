# My First Post

This is a test of using Markdown + Tailwind CSS.

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

This is a paragraph. It should not have any alignment of any kind. It should just flow like you would normally expect. Nothing fancy. Just straight up text, free flowing, with love. Completely neutral and not picking a side or sitting on the fence. It just is. It just freaking is. It likes where it is. It does not feel compelled to pick a side. Leave him alone.

This is another paragraph. It is just as boring as the other one. If you're looking for excitement, you might as well turn around and go back. This is not the place for you. What you're looking for is down the road a ways.

This is a [link](https://example.com). It should be red and underlined. It should have no space after it. It should be inline with the rest of the text.
